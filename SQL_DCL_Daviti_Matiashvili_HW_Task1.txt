task 1-we have several roles in dvd_rental database:pg_checkpoint,
pg_create_subscription,pg_database_owner,pg_execute_server_program,
pg_maintain,pg_monitor,pg_read_all_data, pg_read_all_settings,
pg_read_all_stats,pg_read_server_files,pg_singal_backend,pg_stat_scan_tables,pg_use_reserved_connections,pg_write_all_data,pg_write_server_files,postgres.

in these roles postgres is super user and it's code looks like this
		-- DROP ROLE postgres;

CREATE ROLE postgres WITH 
	SUPERUSER
	CREATEDB
	CREATEROLE
	INHERIT
	LOGIN
	REPLICATION
	BYPASSRLS
	CONNECTION LIMIT -1;

superuser means that it has full control over the database,
createdDB allows role to create new database and createrole allows to
create new roles.
it also inherits the following roles-Login-allows the role to log in database
replication allows replication of the data. bypassrls allows the role to bypass row-level-security policies. connection limit -1 means that it has no
limit of concurrent connections.

all other roles except one has the following code-
NOSUPERUSER
	NOCREATEDB
	NOCREATEROLE
	INHERIT
	NOLOGIN
	NOREPLICATION
	NOBYPASSRLS
	CONNECTION LIMIT -1;

it means that they can do none of these that postgres can.


there is one role pg_monitor-
-- DROP ROLE pg_monitor;

CREATE ROLE pg_monitor WITH 
	NOSUPERUSER
	NOCREATEDB
	NOCREATEROLE
	INHERIT
	NOLOGIN
	NOREPLICATION
	NOBYPASSRLS
	CONNECTION LIMIT -1;

GRANT pg_read_all_settings TO pg_monitor;
GRANT pg_read_all_stats TO pg_monitor;
GRANT pg_stat_scan_tables TO pg_monitor;

it also can do none of this that postgres can but it also grants the ability to do all the things that pg_read_all_settings,pg_read_all_stats and
pg_stat_scan_tables can do since this role is created for monitoring.
